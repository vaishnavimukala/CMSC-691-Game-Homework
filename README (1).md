Gas Station Heist is a compact text adventure where you try to steal cash from a late‑night gas station. The map has five locations (forecourt, shop, alley, manager’s office, getaway car) and a few simple puzzles: find and swipe a keycard to open the office, bribe a thug with chips, and either disarm the safe’s alarm or risk prying it open with a crowbar (which triggers a losing ending). I chose this topic because an everyday setting is easy to picture and keeps the verbs natural (“use keycard”, “give chips”, “drive”), while still letting me demonstrate core mechanics—items, NPC interaction, conditional exits, win/lose states, and meaningful choices within a very small world. The theme also makes it clear how each action changes state (e.g., office_unlocked, thug_bribed, alarm_disarmed, cops_alerted), which fits the assignment’s goals without adding unnecessary complexity.
